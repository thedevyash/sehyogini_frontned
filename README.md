Sehyogini App


Sehyogini is a companion app/web platform designed specifically for single mothers, providing them with a one-stop solution for community support, counseling, and access to various opportunities. Our platform is dedicated to creating a safe and supportive environment free from toxicity, where single mothers can find resources, guidance, and connection with like-minded individuals.


Features
1. Community Section
Our community section provides a moderated space where single mothers can connect, share experiences, and support each other. We employ a multilingual text moderation analysis AI model to measure the toxicity level of posts and comments, ensuring a positive and nurturing environment for all users.


2. Voices Section for Counseling
In the Voices section, users can access counseling sessions with trained professionals. We've integrated a chatbot using the OpenAI API to provide immediate support and guidance to users whenever needed.


3. Opportunities Section
The Opportunities section offers single mothers access to various workshops, government schemes, and job opportunities tailored to their needs. We collaborate with NGOs to host workshops and provide resources for personal and professional development.


Business Model
Our business model revolves around providing valuable services to single mothers while generating revenue through paid workshops and counseling sessions. We also aim to collaborate with government agencies to promote relevant schemes and services.
